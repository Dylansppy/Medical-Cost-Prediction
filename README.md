# Medical cost prediction
## Statement of Intent

## Background 
Prediction of the potential medical cost of an individual could be useful in real-world scenarios such as helping insurance company to determine the personalized premium based on client's personal information, or assisting health insurance bureau to make a budget.

## Introduction
In this project, I intend to develop a program that analyze the 'Medical Cost Personal Datasets' from Kaggle and make prediction of personal healthcare cost based on their individual features.
•	Data Process ( Data exploration, Data cleaning)
