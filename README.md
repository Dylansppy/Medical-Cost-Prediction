# COSC480-Project
## Statement of Intent

## Background 
Prediction of the potential medical cost of an individual could be useful in real-world scenarios such as helping insurance company to determine the personalized premium based on client's personal information, or assisting health insurance bureau to make a budget.

#Intent
So I intend to creat a program that analyse the 'Medical Cost Personal Datasets' from Kaggle and make a prediction of personal healthcare cost based on some features in the dataset.
